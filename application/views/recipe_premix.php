<h2>Potions</h2>
<p class="mix"><a class="mix" href='<?php echo site_url('/workbench/recipes/34') ?>' title=' giant toe fortify health' >Giant's Toe</a> -
	These recipes all gain the "fortify health" effect by using Giant's Toe, which gives them exceptionally high sales value.  Some of them are actually useful potions, as well.
	If you have any Giant's Toe, you probably want to make some of these.</p>
<p class="mix"><a class="mix" href='<?php echo site_url('/workbench/recipes/42') ?>' title=' health potions ' >Health</a> -
	Potions to fortify, restore, and / or regenerate Health (two ingredient recipes only, no harmful effects)</p>
<p class="mix"><a class="mix" href='<?php echo site_url('/workbench/recipes/43') ?>' title=' magicka potions ' >Magicka</a> -
	Potions to fortify, restore, and / or regenerate Magicka (two ingredient recipes only, no harmful effects)</p>
<p class="mix"><a class="mix" href='<?php echo site_url('/workbench/recipes/44') ?>' title=' cure disease potions ' >Cure Disease</a> -
	Easy to make from common ingredients, and you'll probably need one at some point.  Charred Skeever Hide & Mudcrab Chitin is the clear winner in terms of emergency uses, but has very low value.</p>
<p class="mix"><a class="mix" href='<?php echo site_url('/workbench/recipes/47') ?>' title=' power crafting ' >Power Crafting</a> -
	Fortify Enchanting  & Fortify Smithing potions are the foundations of "power crafting" (two ingredient recipes only, no harmful effects)</p>
<p class="mix"><a class="mix" href='<?php echo site_url('/workbench/recipes/48') ?>' title=' resist frost & fire potions ' >Resist Frost &amp; Fire</a> -
	A listing of three ingredient potions to grant both frost and fire resistance, allowing you to pack maximum dragon defense in minimal weight.
	If you have any Hawk's Beak, you can get shock resistance in there too!</p>
<p class="mix"><a class="mix" href='<?php echo site_url('/workbench/recipes/49') ?>' title=' ha ha ha ' >Resist Frost &amp; Magic</a> -
	Perfect for fighting necro-mages.  Sadly, there's no such thing - these settings return zero results.  The same goes for resist fire & magic.  I guess that would make it to easy... </p>

<h2>Poisons</h2>
<p class="mix"><a class="mix" href='<?php echo site_url('/workbench/recipes/50') ?>' title=' paralysis poisons ' >Paralysis</a> -
	A fight winner at low levels, because the paralysis itself is equally effective at low and high levels.  The duration starts at three seconds and gets longer as your alchemy improves.
	Mind you, these have no effect on dragons, undead, and dwemer constructs- but they will knock a giant flat on his back! (two ingredient recipes only, no beneficial effects)</p>


<h2>Miscellaneous Mixtures</h2>
<p class="mix"><a class="mix" href='<?php echo site_url('/workbench/recipes/51') ?>' title=' five effect recipes ' >Five Effects</a> -
	A Listing of the only recipes known to have more than four effects; while fairly profitable to make, they are neither useful nor the most valuable potions known.
	Of the five listed recipes, two are fairly easy to get ingredients for, so you may want to make them anyhow.</p>
